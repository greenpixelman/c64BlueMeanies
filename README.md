## Commodore 64 - Blue Meanies from outer space.

In an alternate universe, we've been asked to bring the 
classic VIC-20 title "Blue Meanies from Outer Space" to the Commodore 64.


## Coding standard:
(Henry Simpson - Serious Programming with the Commodore 64) 

1. REMarks liberally - identify the modules and make sure to have enough REMarks to tell a story.
In the CBM prg Studio, setup the !-- for the comments.

2. One program statement per line.  Simple elegant style!

3. Compress the progam in CBM prg Studio to optimize and save space.
Options->BASIC Code Generation - Remove REM statement, uncheck remote spaces

With code optimize from 'Commodore 64 Exposed' and 'Fredrik Ramsberg'
